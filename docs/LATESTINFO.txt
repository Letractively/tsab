Known issues
  audio buffering is not yet using 1-min splits properly (need a bit more experimenting to prevent small audible gaps between 1-min split fragments)
  search result play button is playing from the beginning, not from the finding (will be fixed together with the proper buffering)
  search results are not paginated
  
Highlights
  command "tsabcli.sh crawl" scans specified dir recursively, adds all .trs files with audio and creates categories with the specified name.
  At this point UI supports only 2-level categories!
  ogg files are automatically converted to mp3 (see docs/INSTALL.txt)
  
  Command line interface tsabcli.sh supports:
  cat-list
  cat-add "CategoryName" [parentCategoryId]
  cat-del CategoryId
  trans-list
  trans-add [path/to/]audio.[mp3|ogg] [path/to/]transcription.trs CategoryId [Title]
  trans-del TranscriptionId
  crawl path/to/dir
  reindex
